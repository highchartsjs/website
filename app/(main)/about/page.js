									<h2>Mission</h2>
									<p> Since the inception of our company, our mission has been simple:&nbsp;Make it
										easy for everyone to visualize data on the web.&nbsp;Over the years, web
										technology (HTML &amp; JavaScript) has become incorporated into everything
										from smart watches and thermostats, to mission-critical financial trading
										applications. Our customer base, and how they use our technology, has
										therefore also evolved. We meet these challenges with a relentless focus
										on delivering the highest quality products and support.</p>
									<p> We also strive to make it easier to consume data. Our charts not only
										intelligently adapt to any device and screen size, but have become the
										gold-standard for making charts accessible to visually impaired users.
										Visit our&nbsp;<a href="/accessibility">Accessibility Portal</a>&nbsp;to learn more about
										Highcharts and Accessibility.</p>

									<h2>Sustainability</h2>
									<p> We are extremely proud to announce our acceptance into the United Nation’s Global Compact,
										the largest voluntary initiative for Corporate Social Responsibility. Furthermore, in 2022, we received our Eco-Lighthouse certification.
										This is visible proof of our efforts towards a green and sustainable future through comprehensive and systematic work with measures in areas such as purchasing,
										energy, transport, waste, emissions and aesthetics.</p>
									<p> Being Eco-Lighthouse certified also contribute to achieving several of the UN’s sustainability goals.
										A sustainable future needs concrete action and a joint effort from both the business community, the authorities and consumers.
										This is an imperative step toward formalizing our work with CSR.</p>
