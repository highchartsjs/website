pageLayout: integrations
description: When our customers tell us they want a new feature, we listen carefully, and if the feature makes sense, we integrate it into our core product. But for edge cases, you may need to override or modify Highcharts’ default functionality by writing your own add-on.<br/>But before you start coding, check out our library of community add-ons. Great minds think alike! Also, check out the community code snippets of cool things you can do with Highcharts’ core library.
