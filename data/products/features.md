- title: work with your stack

- title: Accessibility & Sonification
  content: Highcharts offers an accessible interactive chart solution to empower people with disabilities. Each Highcharts license includes our Accessibility module and a flexible sonification API. The Accessibility module allows you to create charts as accessible as possible, whereas the sonification API helps you support multiple ways to bring data to life with sound. Visit our Accessibility Portal for more information.
- title: Touch and  Mobile-optimized
  content: Intelligent responsiveness not only adjusts the chart to the dimensions of its container but also automatically places non-graph elements such as labels, legends, and headings in the most optimal location. Multi-touch gesture support allows for a native experience on mobile and touch screens. Touch gestures include single touch-drag for data inspection, multi-touch for  zooming, and more.
- title: Annotaions, supporting user interaction
  content: With annotations, developers may describe charts or data points by drawing simple shapes and text anywhere on the canvas or tethered to specific data points. Alternatively, the annotation module includes an API to build user interfaces, such as buttons, toolbars, and dialogues, enabling end-users to place their annotations on a chart. Placement and visibility of annotations intelligently respond to canvas/screen size at run-time.
