- title: Usage
  content: On the server-side, you will need ASP .NET MVC 4+, Visual Studio .NET 2012, and above are highly recommended if you want to open product demos directly. On the client-side, no additional work is necessary. The resulting chart code generates data-driven charts using the rock-solid Highcharts JavaScript library, which dynamically scales across all modern browsers and platforms <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/system-requirements">(Highcharts browser compatibility)</a>
- title: Technology
  content: Our mobile solution encompasses a small JavaScript web view embedded  in your mobile application. This code is identical to the industry-leading Highcharts code,  used across millions of web pages. A dedicated <a href="https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-ios"> iOS wrapper</a> is available for developers who would rather not work with the JavaScript library  directly.
- title: Touch and mobile-optimized
