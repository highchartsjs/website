- title: Simple and Powerful Pythonic API
  description: Highcharts for Python does the heavy lifting of providing a truly Pythonic API. No need to rely on “hacky” solutions involving gigantic Python dict’s, JSON files that only support part of the Highcharts JavaScript capabilities, or switching back and forth between Pythonic snake_case and JavaScript camelCase.

core-features: 
- title: Work Where Your Data Lives
  content: Easily configure highly interactive rich data visualizations in your Python code – where you manage the data, anyway – and deliver those visualizations to your rendering layer with one method call. No need to maintain complicated custom serialization logic, or split your visualization configurations across multiple applications. Keep it simple by managing your visualization where you manage your data.
- title: Works With Your Stack
  content: Highcharts for Python integrates with the most popular components of the Python data science ecosystem. Every Highcharts visualization can be constructed from a Pandas or PySpark DataFrame with one method call, and then rendered in Jupyter Labs/Notebooks using another method call.
- title: Highcharts without the JavaScript
  content: Highcharts is a well-known JavaScript visualization library, but not everyone on your team works in JavaScript. Highcharts for Python translates the full set of JavaScript capabilities into a Pythonic form, using Python snake_case naming conventions, Python import conventions, standard class names, method patterns, etc. Don’t worry about learning JavaScript – Highcharts for Python lets you build the same powerful visualizations while working in Python.
- title: Highly Configurable
  content: Using the Highcharts for Python library, you can configure custom styling, custom configuration, and custom logic for your data visualizations. Easily add custom event handlers, formatter functions, and JavaScript callback functions to give your audience the data experience they need.
- title: One-Call Chart Download
  content: Having configured a beautiful, accessible, and easy-to-understand data visualization you (or your code) can now download it using one method call. Automatic integration with either the Highsoft-provided Highcharts Export Server, or with your own custom Highcharts Export Server deployed in your own environment.
